# Algorithms
An attempt to create a one stop shop for commonly referred algorithms. Useful for interview seekers :)

Simple data structures are chosen to explain the algorithms. The programs as such doesnt have much error handling because the intention is to just explain the implementation in simple manner. 

Willing to contribute? You are welcome! You can learn algorithms by reading books or other tutorials, but make sure you write without referring them or duplicating other programs here. Let it be your own work :)
